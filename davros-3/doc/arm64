arm64 (aarch64) notes

System call is "svc #n". The number n is made available in the exception syndrome register.

Exception vectors and levels - see dv-vectors.S

VBAR	+0		+128	+256	+384
+0		Sync	IRQ		FIQ		SError		from aarch64 EL1 with SP0
+512	Sync	IRQ		FIQ		SError		from aarch64 EL1 with SP1
+1024	Sync	IRQ		FIQ		SError		from aarch64 EL0
+1536	Sync	IRQ		FIQ		SError		from aarch32


Assorted hardware notes:

Raspberry pi SoC (BCM2837):
	Same shitty peripherals as the 1176-based p and pi-zero :-(
	CBAR_EL1 is zero ...
	No GIC - crappy interrupt controller from BCM2835.
    Block of registers (mailboxes, timers and interrupt control registers) at 0x40000000
		(see QA7_rev3.4.pdf)
		What happens on other cores?
			-- IRQ/FIQ outputs seem to be fed to the "GPU" interrupt in the BCM2836 block.
		How to control interrupt-->core mapping?
			-- Register in BCM2836 block controls which core gets IRQ and which core gets FIQ from BCM2835 block.
		How to do inter-core interrupts?
			-- mailboxes in BCM2836 block. Each core has 4 mailboxes, each with 32 separate flags.
	No generic global timer. Have to use systimer/armtimer (no great problem)
		There's also a 64-bit core timer and a 28 bit PIT/watchdog in the BCM2836 block
