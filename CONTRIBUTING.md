# How to contribute

If you have a fix for a bug, please send a patch. I *hate* web interfaces, so don't
send me pull requests.

If you want to help with development, please contact me.

I want to be able to offer davros-3 and/or davroska under a dual license in the future.
If you send me a non-trivial patch, I will need a dual-license agreement from you before I
incorporate it into the tree.
