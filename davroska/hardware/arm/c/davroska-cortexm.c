/* dv_irq() - vector handler for all NVIC interrupt requests.
 *
 * Entry conditions (enforced by hardware):
 *	- running on main stack
 *	- handler mode
 *	- privileged
 *
 * Cortex M's return-from-interrupt mechanism and the NVIC are tightly coupled, with the unfortunate
 * result that if you drop from handler mode to thread mode to execute an ISR, the interrupt will
 * retrigger.
 * There are ways around it, but they're unpleasant. Since davroska is all privileged anyway, ISRs
 * are handled directly at handler level on the main stack.
 * Note: davroska's "kernel stack" and "extended stacks" both use Cortex M's process stack.
 * Theoretically it would be possible to put ISRs directly into the vector table. This has some disadvantages:
 *	- the vector table would occupy 336 bytes of RAM.
 *	- ISRs would no longer be "executables" in davroska.
 *	- davroska would need some modifications to prevent tasks that get activated during ISRs from running
 *	  immediately. Some hardware heuristic would be needed.
 *	- davroska assumes that ISRs are manage like tasks using the queue mechanism. Changing that would also
 *	  require changes in davroska
 *
 * The implementation adopted activates the ISRs as executables and runs them immediately on the main stack.
 * The dv_runqueued function is prevented from scheduling tasks by raising the current executable's priority to
 * the highest task priority.
 * Stack switching is inhibited by setting the onkernelstack flag to 1.
 * The original values are restored at the end of the processing.
 * If an ISR wakes up a task that has a higher priority than the current task, the "cortex m" method of
 * triggering a pendsv interrupt is used. When all interrupt processing is finished (including
 * nested interrupts) the pendsv handler pushes a preemption frame onto the interrupted process stack (which
 * might be the "kernel" stack or the private stack of an extended task). See dv_pendsvtrap() for details.
