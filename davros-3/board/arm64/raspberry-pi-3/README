Files in this directory support the Cortex A53 (ARMv8) based Raspberry Pi boards such as the
Pi3 in 64-bit mode.

Memory map of this board:

0x00000000 - 0x3effffff  RAM
0x3f000000 - 0x3fffffff  BCM2835 peripherals (same as pi-zero & co)
0x40000000 - ???         BCM2836 peripherals (same as pi2)

So for 1:1 address mapping, MMU can be configured with "input" address range = "output" address range = 32 bits.
This means (I hope) that we can use a 4-entry L1 table (bits 31-30) to get 4KiB pages.
