/* dv_arm64_vectors_t - a data type that describes the vector table.
 *
 * On arm64 cpus there's always a vector base address register, so there's never any need to copy vector tables.
 * All we need is to put the address of the vector table in the appropriate VBAR.
 *
 * We only ever take the address of the vector table, so a simple address is sufficient.
 *
 * See dv_vectors.s for the contents.
