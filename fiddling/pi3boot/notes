SCTLR_ELn	Controls architectural features, for example the MMU, caches and alignment checking.

TCR_ELn 	Determines which of the Translation Table Base Registers define the base address [...]

TTBR0_ELn	Holds the base address of translation table 0, and information about the memory it occupies.

TTBR1_ELn	Holds the base address of translation table 1, and information about the memory it occupies.


Output:  (the meaning of the bits given is "when 1")
