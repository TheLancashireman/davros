Top level Makefile is in davros/

Makefile puts object files into davros/bin/obj/, libraries and linked binaries into bin/

Makefile sets include path to board/$(FAMILY)/$(BOARD)/h. This directory contains dv-boardconfig.h
which is included by kernel/h/dv-kconfig.h. dv-kconfig.h is included first by *all* C files and by dv-asm.h
dv-asm.h is included by all .S files.

All other header files are included via path relative to davros/ (e.g. kernel/h/dv-foo.h)
CPU-family files are included from common files using a macro.

dv-boardconfig.h is responsible for setting up the kernel configuration for the board.
Usually, much of the configuration is delegated to the CPU family by means of
cpufamily/XXX/h/dv-XXX-kconfig.h

Project configuration (feature selection, array sizes) in project/h/dv-projectconfig.h
