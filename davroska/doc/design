Single-stack OSEK-like OS
========================

Basic concept:
	* everything done by direct function calls
		* all privileged, no memory protection, etc.
	* activate a task
		* if higher priority than current, just "call" it
			* "call" wrapper: use setjmp() or similar to record position
			* "terminate" longjmp()
			* return from top level
		* otherwise enqueue it
			* during termination, "call" next exe
	* extended task
		* use stub stackframe on main stack
		* switch to private stack for task
		* switch back to main stack on termination or wait
